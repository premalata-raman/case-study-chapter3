# Business questions

Your analytical and business skills are needed to provide clarity in the following aspects:

- How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
- How many products are being discounted?
- How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
- How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
- How could data collection be improved?
