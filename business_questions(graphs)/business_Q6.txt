1. Ensure Data Completeness
Current Observation: Missing or incomplete values can lead to inaccurate analysis, as seen in columns like price, promo_price, and date in your dataset.
Improvement Suggestion:
Implement validation checks during data entry to ensure all fields are filled.
Use default or estimated values for mandatory fields (e.g., assign a default price for missing products based on category).

2. Improve Data Consistency
Current Observation: Inconsistent data formats (e.g., price and promo_price as strings instead of numeric) required coercion and cleaning.
Improvement Suggestion:
Standardize formats for dates, numeric values, and categorical data at the source (e.g., ensuring numeric fields only accept numbers).
Use dropdowns or predefined options for categorical fields like event, type, or state.

3. Capture Additional Attributes
Current Observation: Limited attributes for deep analysis (e.g., no demographic data for customers, no product categories).
Improvement Suggestion:
Collect additional data points such as:
Customer demographics: Age, gender, location, preferences.
Sales channels: Online, in-store, third-party platforms.
Product metadata: Categories (electronics, clothing, etc.), brands, suppliers.

4. Real-Time or Periodic Data Updates
Current Observation: The dataset appears static, possibly requiring manual updates or aggregation.
Improvement Suggestion:
Implement systems to collect data in real-time (e.g., from sales transactions or website logs).
Automate periodic data exports from systems like POS (Point of Sale) or ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).

5. Track Event-Specific Sales
Current Observation: Event-driven sales analysis (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas) requires manual tagging.
Improvement Suggestion:
Automatically tag sales data with relevant events based on date ranges.
Create a dedicated column to classify transactions as "Event-Based" or "Regular" at the point of data collection.
